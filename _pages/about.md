Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.... -->



My name is Yueh-Hsuan (Helena) Huang, and I am a fourth-grade Electrical Engineering student at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/). I am an engineer that has a passion for building intelligent, cross-disciplinary solutions. My work focuses on the intersection of machine learning, software engineering, and real-world application.

I am grateful for the opportunity to have gained the following experience:

:mortar_board: Academic Research: 

-  Developing transfer learning models for recommendation systems as an [NSTC-funded undergraduate research project](https://www.nstc.gov.tw/folksonomy/list/2af9ad9a-1f47-450d-b5a1-2cb43de8290c?l=ch) at [iDSSP Lab](https://www.idssp.ee.ntu.edu.tw/), advised by [Prof. Che Lin](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=25203).

-  Discussed the possibility of using tensor networks in supervised learning, aiming to improve the interpretability of machine learning models, advised by [Dr. Hong-Yan Shih](https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/~hongyan/) from the [Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica](https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/)

:briefcase: Industry Internships & Collaborations:
  
-  [TVBS](https://www.tvbs.com.tw/) (AI Future Tech Department, Taiwan's top news media company): Engineered automated news scheduling workflows using automation tool [n8n](https://n8n.io/) and Google Cloud Platform.
  
-  [momo.com Inc.](https://corp.momo.com.tw/) (Taiwan's top e-commerce platform): Tackled challenges in logistics technology and product compliance.

My mentors have been invaluable in my journey; they not only helped me to think like an engineer but also inspired me to be more creative. Feel free to check out these experience in the projects page.

My approach to problem-solving is guided by two core principles: the intellectual rigor of a researcher and the unwavering discipline of an athlete. I am actively seeking opportunities in the media or e-commerce industries where I can apply my skills in a dynamic and collaborative environment. 

Beyond my academic and professional life, sports are a significant part of who I am. As the Vice Captain of the NTUEE women's basketball team for the past 1.5 years (and continuing for the next year), I've learned invaluable lessons from basketball and sports in general.
